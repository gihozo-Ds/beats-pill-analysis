R2OYAX691GNN4K,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars One of the Best Compact Portable Speakers,Student Nurse,5,"I picked this up at the Apple Store the other day when trading in my old MacBook for the college promo (Gift card of $150 with purchase). With my gift card, I decided to inquire about the new Beats Pill that they have in store. One of the reasons I went for this item is because it was essentially free for me ($150 speaker + $150 Gift Card = Gift to me). Below is my review:Sound Quality: In the formative years of the Beats Pill, it has been a very popular speaker to consumers who are shopping for a unit that is under the $300 price tag. Just like the Beats headphones, this speaker is very well known to the general public & even further to the audiophiles (Like Myself). My first thoughts of the sound quality were ‚ÄúHow is this going to sound?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWill this live up to its price?‚Äù & ‚ÄúHow good is the build quality?‚Äù. Needless to say, when I got it up & running, WOW WAS I IMPRESSED!!!!!!This generation of Beats Pill blows every one off its predecessors in the water. The woofer alone is unbelievably powerful with the incorporation of newer & more durable materials. It reproduces great lows along with outstanding mids & highs. As for the tweeter, I believe this was also upgraded. The clarity from the tweeter is exceptional & performs well even at higher volumes.Build: The new build quality is MUCH more advanced than previous models. To start, the speaker is now on a(n) angle to promote better sound distribution throughout your space. The materials used to bring this speaker together feel very durable & solid. In addition to the new build, the speaker offers a plethora of other great features including a(n) IP67 rating, better battery life & a whole new look.Other Comment(s): The only comment I have about this speaker (Which I am sure is correctable by a software update in the near future) is with the on/off function(s). This was a little tricky for me at first, but I eventually figured it out. In order to turn the speaker on/off, you have to hold the power button for 1-3 seconds (I usually do it for 2 seconds & it works). This may be a turn off for some consumers as a lot of people today don‚Äôt want to go through the trouble of having to learn how to turn it on/off the right way.Overall: I would say that all in all, this is a great speaker for under $200 if you are in the market for great sound quality, portability & power. I bought the ‚ÄúStatement Red‚Äù as the ostentatious or loud red color got my attention & I loved it (I personally like speakers with crazy colors / designs). If you are in the market for one, either buy it here or check it out in person. Needless to say, you won‚Äôt be disappointed with this speaker.","Reviewed in the United States September 4, 2024",AFTRAIYZ5AITM2MEV2H2DNAHW73Q,False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

R3A0CT3JVYDFX3,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Bass Heavy,Geomancer,4,"As you can probably tell from the product description heavily focusing on the subwoofer, you won't be surprised to learn that this speaker is very bass heavy. That's fine for songs that complement that kind of sound, but is a determent to anything else. For example listening to an audio book it doesn't sound very good and I actually prefer my phone's built in speaker or a regular set of headphones. There is no EQ feature, even if you download the Beats app. Speaking of the Beats app, it doesn't really have any use. It will tell you battery life, and remind you what the controls are, but that's it. The ""one touch connect"" feature did not work, I had to manually connect in my Bluetooth settings (Android, Samsung Galaxy S20 FE).For controls there are four buttons. A power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up. They are the same color as the speaker, do not light up, and are difficult to see. I initially had some trouble turning it off because you have to hold the power button. However if you don't hold it long enough it just gives you a battery life indicator, hold it too long it goes into pairing mode. You have a 2-3 second window between those two functions to actually get it to turn off.Volume wise, it does get pretty loud. Loud enough to hurt if you're nearby. Bass of course travels well and far, be aware that you will annoy your neighbors if your outside with the volume up. Perhaps even at a mid volume because it is so bass heavy. Not great for apartments because of that, at least if you don't want to be that annoying neighbor.If you have two of these, you can sync them together either to just make them even louder (why would anyone want that? It already hurts at max volume), or as a stereo pair.For the price, I would have preferred a speaker with a more balanced audio profile. For tracks that do emphasize bass though it does sound pretty good. Overall I would classify my annoyances other than the sound profile as minor.","Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2024",AHS6VNLQVHWZLOI3RZ6ZXUWPK4OA,False,12,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R31FPPEOE54HHH,B0D4SX9RC6,4.0 out of 5 stars Not bad for the price,M.J. Shearer,4,"I own a plethora of bluetooth speakers, one even costing 10x this one. But, for a small portable form factor, this pill doesn't sound half bad. It is definitely not my favorite in the sound quality department, but the portability factor makes it a keeper. Right now, I'm testing it on my kitchen window sill and it provides me with adequate sound whilst I rustle up grub for the fam. Highs are clear, mids are punchy, bass is present but it won't knock your socks off. If you're looking for a balance between portability and sound quality, then this might be your ticket at 150$. BUT, if you want better sound quality, save up another 100 bux and you can find a larger (even much larger) speakers that will SA-MOKE this one, but, you WILL sacrifice portability. One issue I found with this speaker is that the rubberized texture on the back is a dust and animal hair magnet. (Two cats and two GSD's...you GSD owners out there know the struggle) It will not wipe clean with your hand, but a very damp paper towel works like a charm.","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2024",AFIPEJWLO34BKCROKOXTQOTHWOIQ,False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
R1IDSWYH8GDHSG,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars Beats pill returned with an amazing and sleek speaker for IOS/ android,Alan,5,"This is a very small and compact speaker, but for its size, it packs a serious punch. It's comparable to the JBL Flip 6. Sure, that speaker has even better bass, but this more complete package for its price, with speakerphone and in my opinion, more sexy design.-The bass is great, and the overall mid and high range is excellent, but I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs the best among portable speakers. This is overall a very bass-heavy speaker. I only own the black one, but I‚Äôm interested in trying out other models when I get a gold one (because it‚Äôs sexy af).-This is definitely the best-looking and sleekest portable speaker. It‚Äôs minimal, smooth, and easy to carry around. Sure, for the price, you can argue that you can get a ‚Äúbetter‚Äù speaker, but what this speaker offers is a well-rounded package: nice sound with great bass, goes well with home decor without sticking out, and minimal with a beautiful design. It's especially easy to access if you're an Apple user. Speakerphone has decent clarity and nice usages in times.-Even though it says 24 hours of battery life, take it with a grain of salt. The fact is, the higher the volume you play, the more battery it consumes because it uses more power in the drivers and woofers to push out bass and sounds. So, don‚Äôt complain too much if you see faster drainage than advertised, lol. I play around 60%-70% volume range and very bass heavy songs. so I get about 6 1/2 hours from what I observed. Yours might vary.-The biggest critique I have is that it‚Äôs the worst-sounding speaker if you go above 80% volume. The distortion and fuzzy sound are awful. The higher the volume, the less bass you‚Äôll hear, and the highs and mids kick in instead. To be fair, most small speakers are like this anyways. The best volume range I found is 30%-70%, especially 60%, which produces the most balanced bass and highs.In conclusion, if you want a small yet sleek speaker with great sound, then this is for you.By the way, don‚Äôt even compare this to the JBL Charge 5. It literally has different usage, and the size difference is there, lmao. A bigger and more expensive speaker can push out more sound and bass, LMAO. So yeah, it‚Äôs kind of like comparing apples to pears, lmao. I only say this because so many people compare this to the Charge 5 or other bigger speakers.","Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2024",AFASPTXSH53KJIWIFP33WH2XDYXA,False,1,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

Sure, I can listen to music on my computer, but I prefer to have music playing in the background which is not interrupted by computer sounds (same reason I use an Android music player instead of my phone to stream music). Overall, I really like this Beats Pill, and I'm glad I ordered it.","Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2024",AFSTPCHMSCLW3BXOBMFT5E3I4XXQ,False,0,Color: Champagne GoldStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+
RCS6YZDDME20Y,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars The Pill punches far above it's weight class!!,Brian Severn,5,"Beats Pill (2024) is a high quality product, from the Apple'esque packaging, to the incredible sound output from this small [tiny?] Bluetooth speaker. Incredibly easy to use, connect via Bluetooth and your off to the races.This speaker is about the diameter of a Coke can, albeit longer. It has a pre-attached teather that seems strong enough. Claims to be IP67 water resistant. It comes with a small instruction manual and a USB-C charging cable (USB-C YAY!!!). They claim the battery life is 24 hrs, and it may well be as we've been evaluating it for about a week off and on every day and it's still going strong.I tested it via Bluetooth, mainly streaming via Apple Music, and or it's size it packs quite a punch! Decent mids and highs, and it has bass! Not tons of bass [expected for it's size, it's just physics), but it's decent, if not exceptional given the size of this, but that is expected of any Beats branded speaker product, and this one doesn't disappoint! Another neat feature is that it allows the pairing to two Pill units for stereo music. It's easy to control, there are four buttons: power button, multi-function button (play/pause/next/previous), volume down, and volume up.I really like It also has a built-in mic so you can use it as a speaker phone as well, and it works pretty good.In summary, for the price, compared to other ""party"" speakers around the same price class, the Pill punches far above it's weight class, feature sound clarity with decent bass, lots of volume, and simplicity in design as we've come to expect from Beats. While maybe not the cheapest ""party"" speaker out there, it is among one of the best, if not the best, in it's price class.","Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2024",AGMUT4BKXZBD5PKSMOD2QHVHSKZA,False,1,Color: Statement RedStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

Pairing is quick and easy, and the connection remains stable without any drops. There is a built-in microphone that is a handy feature for taking calls or using voice commands. The call quality is clear, and the microphone picks up my voice well, even in noisy environments.

It has a detachable lanyard that makes it easy to carry, and a silicone backing for an easy grip. Despite the small size, it delivers powerful sound with good bass and clear highs. I mostly use this out by the pool, so I like the IP67 water rating. It‚Äôs been heavily splashed several times, with no ill effects. The battery life is excellent, and easily lasts me through a couple of days of listening. It comes with a USB-C TO USB-C charging cable.I love that this doubles as a speakerphone. I can connect it to my laptop for work calls, and the sound quality is excellent. Beats is a quintessentially Apple product, but don‚Äôt let that scare you off if you‚Äôre an Android fan like myself.

I like that it is part of the apple family and I can easily move from one device to another quickly and seamlessly.The only minor thing i dont like is that the buttons are a little confusing. there are only 4 of them but you access certain features by long pressing or pressing combinations of buttons which is just unnecessarily complicated. I understand the reason why- its inline with the clean minimalist aesthetic that Steve Jobs expected of all apple products .

You still get the pill shape, but now there's some nice updates like the lossless type C listening, improved bass drivers and larger battery capacity...about of days worth of Beats now!The packaging and design are definitely exquisite...it is an Apple product, and it shows in the design and style. There's support for both Apple and Android too which is nice.Sound quality is superb as expected too. Sharp highs and nice thick, booming bass. It definitely leans to a heavier bass sound, which is fine as the end result is still really balanced and crisp.The verdict?

R2W2XN52WGT97C,B0D4SX9RC6,5.0 out of 5 stars HUGE audio punch in a small package - just what you expect from Beats!,Brett,5,"Beats has long been popular for producing audio products - headphones, earbuds, speakers and so on - with great sound that are loud and pack a punch in the form of ""boosted"" bass notes. In that case, this new Pill wireless speaker is more of the same great recipe. In a fairly compact form factor you get a Bluetooth speaker (it can connect with any Bluetooth device though the documentation is focused rightfully on what most people will do - either Apple or Android phones) that gets VERY loud with VERY rich/boosted bass. The audio is also clear for things like spoken word, so that's a positive overall.Outside of that, the Pill is water resistant (not waterproof, so don't drop it in the pool or leave it out in a thunderstorm, but it's okay - probably - if it gets splashed a bit or drizzled on somewhat - meaning that it's great for outdoor parties given the volume) and has solid battery life. I do like that it can act as a portable battery bank, charging phones if you need to. It's not the primary function, but it's nice to see manufactures add value-added extra functionality that doesn't require any extra accessories or things to carry along. The Pill appears to be very well-built and should prove quite durable. As an added bonus, all the packaging is recyclable - kudos to Beats on that!So if you like your music loud and bass heavy, then this is the wireless speaker for you. If that's the case, give it a try today!","Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2024",AGN7FGMJLQ4WZBWMAZMMJYJOFPSQ,False,0,Color: Matte BlackStyle: PillPattern: Without AppleCare+

There is no dedicated power button, and in fact there are no instructions anyplace in the Apple/Beats ecosystem that tell you how to turn it off. (Push the Action button for more than 1, but less than 1.8 seconds.... how dumb is that?) With only 4 buttons, there are too many button sequence combos to remember.

Then I bought the JBL Flip 6 which is smaller, but still can pack a nice punch... but only if you turn it up really loud. I really love the JBL Flip 6 because it is extremely portable, but I decided that I wanted to try this JBL Charge 5 because I love the camouflage pattern on it, and it seemed like a good in-between speaker from the other two speakers I'm comparing here. As it turns out, the JBL Charge 5 is the best choice for me in terms of portability, and sound. It's got a really nice full sound, and I don't have to turn it up quite as loud as the JBL Flip 6 to achieve the full sound I like. That means to me that I have more volume to play with if I really jam out to some good music. In the future I would like to try the JBL Extreme, even though I know it's not as portable as these other speakers I have.

R3B50FJN1UU9BC,B08X4XBB26,3.0 out of 5 stars Audio Engineers point of view,Christo,3,"I purchased two of these to work as a stereo pair in my apartment to obtain a nice full sound without having to really crank the volume to have an enjoyable experience and bother the neighbors.Well it all started out great, the white look clean and are small enough to not take up too much visual space. They also sound fantastic for a battery powered speaker, relatively full low end and crisp highs without needing to be EQed. They are setup roughly 15‚Äô feet from one another in opposing corners of my studio space. They add presence and a fullness that I was missing from my Notabrick Bluetooth speakers.Now for THE PROBLEMS:I synced the speakers together and switched them to ‚Äústereo‚Äù mode from the app with no problem using my iPhone 13 Pro running Bluetooth 5.1. When it was time to connect it to my stationary media hub it was intended for (a 2020 iPad 8th gen) it would only connect one speaker and not allow for a party link or stereo link between the two Charge 5‚Äôs anymore. It took my some time of testing and no help from the internet to find out that the Bluetooth 4.2 that the iPad uses means the JBLs could no longer connect in a pair. I figured they had their own connection protocol (perhaps wifi 2.4ghz) for party mode. This shared audio functionality will ONLY work if your device that is sending audio is Bluetooth 5.1.SECOND ISSUE:So I put the iPad aside and would only be using my iPhone for music since that‚Äôs the only way I could get the Stereo mode to function. But after 15-30 minutes of music playback the speakers will disconnect themselves from one another requiring you to manually go to them and reconnect themselves. Every third time or so they will also drop the Bluetooth connection requiring you to ‚Äúforget device‚Äù on your phone and resync Bluetooth to your host Charge 5 and then relink the speakers.This is all to say that if you want to use more than one speaker, even using a compatible Bluetooth 5.1 device that they are extremely finicky. Using a single Charge 5 has proved to be very reliable, sound great and look great. I am an audiophile and have many thousands of dollars in pro audio.The current tested Firmware version is 0.8.6.0 and has not been updated for over a year so this is unlikely to be fixed.UPDATE: I purchased two Charge 4 speakers to run through all the same testing and scenarios as the newer Charge 5 Models and found that with the exception of the occasional dropout and auto reconnection (perhaps once every two hours or so) these have solved all my issues. In fact, having the Aux plug on this model has also meant I can plugin my DJ decks to them when we are at the park and the primary speaker that is being plugged into will duplicate the signal and send it to the second speaker wirelessly with no issues. There is about one second of lag with this setup so the use of my DJ headphones is a requirement, but I love the added functionality. I also find the battery meters to be much more easy to read on the Charge 4. Finally, I do not know if it's because the transmission power of the Bluetooth 4.2 in the Charge 4 over the Bluetooth 5.1 in the Charge 5, but I find that I get a longer transmission range with no dropouts with the older Charge 4 model. On paper this should be backwards but testing 4 independent units in different scenarios have shown this to be recurring findings for me. I have used the 2020 iPad, iPhone 13 pro and Macbook M1 pro and a HD Firestick as my test subjects.I do notice that the Charge 5 has a slight edge in real world testing for maximum volume and clearly has a crisper high end to it where the Charge 4 sounds a little more round but is still very pleasing to the ear. I suggest to save a ton of money and pickup the Charge 4 if you are planning on using them in a multi speaker setup like me.","Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2023",AE5UFAYXB2EX2T4NQ5HFHWATP6NA,True,22,Color: White

R1D9I181C4INKE,B08X4XBB26,5.0 out of 5 stars Great little speakers,The pc builder,5,So let start off by I‚Äôm old school when it comes to selecting speaker. I have a massive surround system that sound great! I stumbled across the little speaker by accident. So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands‚Ä¶ I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great. So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing. So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers. So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode. I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too!!! So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them. The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me. Now I starting thinking of 2.1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright. Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers!!! Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush - The Weapon.. this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation. I also played Led Zeppelin‚Äôs- Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound. Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long. I‚Äôd like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM/FM with USB and SD card. In closing don‚Äôt overlook these speaker I really enjoy my little speaker and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll love too!!!!,"Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2024",AFPGGENH3QGVQQIBUDQY26SDVVKA,True,3,Color: Black

Alot of bass comes out of these little speakers. They were smaller then i had anticipated wich is good for the kayaks. But wow sound great and can be tweeked by eq in app to sound even better to your liking. They also sell accessories like carrying strap and mounts.

It does have great Bose sound, as you would expect. Tho I was after a much bigger sound this time. I really wanted the JBL Boombox, as I have heard them play! But I didn't want to indulge and spend the $400 plus dollars. I‚Äôve had Bose sound before and this was down to a reasonable price for a change. It‚Äôs a great lil speaker. But if you want bigger sound you‚Äôre gonna have to spend the money and go for a bigger version of Bose. This is plenty loud for a great number of people who are just wanting the premium sound :) All in all was a good buy and worth the money for its size and output. Easy to no set up, outta the box charge and play! Also, there is a number of inexpensive covers, cases, frames that make it a ‚Äúboombox‚Äù with handles for easy take along. It came with its own charge cord and a quality clip for the heavy duty loop that‚Äôs built in, so you can clip/hang the speaker wherever you like.

Sound quality is fantastic at all volume levels, its durable and holds up pretty well to the elements. The battery does genuinely last a full 8-10 hour shift playing constantly. A few things to note however.There are no EQ controls for it. Sound is well balanced but theres no bass boost, treble, no nada built in.The app is unnecessary once you get it set up with your device, really only need it to check the battery. The speaker will tell you what its battery percentage is if you turn it off and on though.Max volume is entirely dependent on the device its paired to. If i pair it to my PC, max volume is pretty quiet. If i pair it to my buddy's phone it gets pretty loud, but nowhere near as loud as it is paired to my phone.Volume controls are independent from the device and speaker. You can turn your speaker volume to max but your device is the primary control. So if you have the speaker on low volume and your phone all the way to the max, it wont be as loud as both at max, and vice versa. Its very odd.It does not remember the bluetooth volume of the device its paired to, so if you turn it off and use it the next day, it has a habit of being at full blown volume by default. Just be mindful.Other than that, its excellent and no one will be disappointed by it.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AHEGWVGORT2NYKVPVFMFBFDUYI7Q,True,2,Color: Black

I don‚Äôt consider myself an audiophile, but I do listen to music religiously ‚Äî 100k+ hours annually ‚Äî and I can appreciate a crisp sounding speaker with nuance. This speaker lacks the nuance. It‚Äôs not terribly loud in my opinion, even on full volume in my small apartment. However, it is durable, and I love that it‚Äôs waterproof. Upon further research, I discovered that Bose is actually NOT worth the value for the money ‚Äî many audiophiles recommend purchasing from another brand, as these speakers can be made for less than $50 and sold for $400+. Initially I purchased the Bose Soundlink MAX and another Flex (product listed here) as well, in hopes of amplifying the sound as well as achieving stereo sound in my apartment.After doing some research, I returned the Soundlink Max and one of the Flex speakers as well. I purchased some ELAC speakers instead for HOME use, and kept one of the Bose Flex speakers for shower use and traveling, as I spend a lot of time on the beach and this is dust and drop resistant. I purchased this on Prime Day for $99 before tax. I would NOT say it‚Äôs worth $150 full price. The battery is not great. I can leave it charging overnight and it dies with moderate use before the day is over. Mediocre in performance overall.It‚Äôs worth nothing that when I purchased the Soundlink Max from Amazon, the box itself clearly states that the speaker comes from Bose ‚ÄúRETURNS AND REPLACEMENTS.‚Äù I believe the speakers sold on sale are probably speakers that were defected or returned by other customers.

R1M9Q905GCUV87,B0CQF7TQP4,2.0 out of 5 stars Keeping 2 of these paired is continual work.,Cliffton Mcintire,2,"These speakers are OK to take to the beach and setup for a special occasion.These SUCK for everyday use. Once you set up a pair of these, they will randomly forget about each other, and then repair individually with your playback source so they must be re-paired to each other. Even without any interraction with other bluetooth play sources, they will randomly forget about each other.Here's what I have to do Every. Effing. Day.- Figure out which player(s) want to pair with them and disconnect, at the source.- Some play sources will reconnect automatically as I restart the speakers for pairing. These sources must fully purge the bluetooth speaker configuration so you can successfully re-pair the speakers.If I'm lucky, re-pairing goes ""smoothly"", but requires a very specific ritual:- Turn off secondary speaker (you'll figure out which one this is after a few hours of pointless BS)- Turn off primary speaker.- Turn on primary speaker.- At this point your secondary _might_ turn on, and you're good to go.- About half the time you must turn on the secondary yourself.- If you had to turn on the secondary, then you need to press the bluetooth pairing button- At this point the speaker _might_ re-pair- If they don't re-pair then you must also sacrifice a goat and then do the FULL RE-PAIR procedure:FULL RE-PAIR:- Turn off both speakers- Turn on your primary- Open your proprietary Sony app on your phone, find primary- Set up pairing mode- Turn on secondary- Find secondary and add to pair- Let them negotiate for 30 seconds, or 5 minutes.- You might need to bring both speakers and phone within 10 feet of each other for this to workOnce everything's re-paired, you can reenable the speakers on your playback source.Be very careful not to pair to one of them after they've forgotten each other, because then it's likely that you'll have to set everything up again. Be aware that many systems will automatically reconnect to whichever was primary, whether the primary is aware of the secondary at that moment or not. So they are continually breaking themselves.","Reviewed in the United States August 20, 2024",AFTDXEHBA4V3NHAZX27BG7QI46CA,True,0,Style: SRS-XP500

RGTJJOH9ZDC9W,B0CQF7TQP4,4.0 out of 5 stars Sony srs-xp700 vs JBL partybox 310,rw,4,"Let's be honest, you're probably looking at the Sony xp700 because the JBL partybox 310 is sold out and because it's now $100 less than the JBL. Well, the JBL is indeed a better ""party' speaker. Much better/deeper bass at volume, better light features, easier to transport with the wheels and telescoping handle, and it even has a hole for a speaker stand, meaning you can elevate it over a dance floor and project the sound further. If your primary use case is throwing medium to large dance parties or hosting events, hands down go with the JBL. Keep in mind, neither speakers have RCA or XLR inputs, so if you're trying to start a side-hustle as a DJ, neither speaker will be the best choice, but the JBL is the closest to an amateur DJ speaker.However, the Sony is actually a better ""casual"" speaker. IMO, it looks less ostentatious and more classy/understated than the JBL, with a more subtle light feature. It looks good and will aesthetically work just about anywhere, from a formal social event to a casual house party with friends. It has better sound quality at low volumes and simply a greater range of lower volume levels. Meaning, if you want softer background music during a dinner or a social event, the Sony will give you a wider range of volume levels to work with, whereas the JBL wants to blast music as loud as possible. Further, I feel the Sony has a more balanced sound and is just more usable for a wider range of situations, barring loud raves or crazy dance parties. The Sony also offers better battery life, and has battery saving features, which means the battery might last longer than the JBL over the years, since it will need fewer charge cycles.In conclusion, if you're a wanna be DJ, just looking to host dance parties and basement raves, stick the JBL. However, if you're like most people, and you want a good speaker for a wide range of situations, from listening to music in your living room, to throwing a birthday party, to hosting a formal cocktail event on your patio, the Sony is the more versatile option, aside from not having ANY audio out jack to daisy chain with different brand speakers and not being able to mount it on a speaker stand. Overall, a decent buy as long as it's less than the JBL.

There are these small rubber feet that go on the side of the speaker so that it can stand vertical or horizontal while listening. The rubber feet on the bottom of the vertical side are built really well, but the feet on the horizontal side are horrible and fall off really easily. I've had it for a month and a half, brought it 3 or 4 places, and I have one rubber foot left for the horizontal side. The rest fell off easily in transport and they sell them for $9 each online. Worst part is that the speaker isn't really that tall, so I've preferred having it horizontal on a table or countertop but now it doesn't sit balanced on its side which causes it to rattle against the counter/table. Classic stupid little problem that some people won't care about, but unfortunately it drives me crazy and it's probably too late to return it to upgrade to the better model.","Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2023",AEQJMC7UDDSKKC4GGMI7EBWKKH4A,True,3,Style: SRS-XP700

Rozell,4,"When I looked at the box on my doorstep, I thought that Amazon had done another one of those too-big-of-a-box-jobs for a much smaller product. WOW! Was I wrong!! This thing is huge!!!Anyway, exclamation marks aside, I did not read the dimensions for this beast but it's over 2 feet tall (26""!) and at least a foot square for the footprint. Needless to say, the guy who recommended the wagon to carry this portable speaker is spot-on. There is no way you're throwing this on your shoulder and walking down the street.For the sound, it is definitely a BOOMbox. I've tried the Hyperboom and the JBL Boombox and they don't compare with both the depth and overall sound output of this thing. Then again, those other two in size are more along the lines of the XG500, not nearly the size of this one. Anyway, it has thunderous bass and really good mids and highs. Can't say I'm a huge distinguisher in terms of the latter two sounds, but the overall sound is just good quality.Overall, I paid $338 for an Amazon Warehouse Deal and it's the most I'd ever pay for one speaker (called ""Acceptable"" but I do not see anything that makes this less than ""Very Good"" or even ""Like New""?). For that price point, it's definitely worth it. At the retail price, I'm pretty sure I would NOT have considered it as any speaker over $400 is going to have a hard time justifying itself.One other important note for those that like to have multiple speakers (and have suffered issues with JBL's systems): It easily hooks into my Bluetooth, as well as Party-Connects with my various other Sony speakers (XB33, XB43, and XG500).","Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2022",AGIJSH465VTT2G7TNCHMK2FI2MTQ,True,13,Style: SRS-XP700

Every year she hosts a musical and other musical-related things. In the past she was using a very small pill style speaker for rehearsals. That old speaker would not come close to filling the auditorium during rehearsals, and the house speakers are often inaccessible during rehearsal hours for various reasons.I got her this since it will accept a microphone and guitar/keyboard input, Bluetooth audio and has a very good battery life spec. Sonically, this is a lot closer to the auditorium speakers so her students will come a little closer to ""practicing like they play"".This speaker has a whole lot of features with modest sound customization. Based on my wife's reaction, this speaker will do essentially everything she would ask it to. This includes PA system, speaker for rehearsals and performances, and home listening and entertaining. Also, the battery life on this thing is very good in real world use as well.It seems like it is well-built and is relatively hefty at around 38 lbs. For this reason, I also got my wife a dolly-style collapsible luggage carrier to make transport easier.The sound on the SRS-XP700 is very good overall. The balance is pretty solid. The sound stage is pretty consistent and full in a standard room, and also fills a large space or outdoors very well.

That's pathetic, and I tested it.At 25%, people in the room with me were carrying on a quiet conversation 4' away from the speaker.^^^ That's ALL you need to know right there^^^ But I will carry on.At 100%, if I walk away 40', I can easily carry on a quiet conversation and not hear the lyrics of the speaker.The lights seem to have no rhythm or rhyme to them. They just randomly blind. They remind me of those old robotic characters at chuck e cheese that just kinda danced around randomly.The lights are very muted as well, and then I realize the lights are NOT on the speaker itself, they are reflecting off of the grab bars onto the surface of the speaker.I used to love sony products. I strived to get everything Sony. Not I can name one that I have. I dont know what happened to them. They were the quality that no one could beat seemingly forever but yea they cost alot.Maybe this is just how bluetooth speakers work. We tried on an android device and apple device. The volume was the same.The sounds overall I should note, are very muted. No crystal clear highs, the mid range seemed like they turned it way down to be almost like a heavy metal tuned speaker.Dont get me wrong it was ok. I wouldnt be upset if this was only $100 and I wasnt trying to get something loud enough to fill an outdoor picnic pavilion. I need people in the back to hear what is being said over the mic, and shouldnt need to turn to 100% to make that happen, but I also want those people enjoying the music loud enough outside of the pavilion and then as you get inside get loud enough whereas people might even dance. This just doesnt put out that volume. Maybe my expectations are too high, but the JBL party box 110 I listened to one day, was damn loud, and it wasnt on the highest volume.","Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2022",AFUV42HFAXVUPVZUAMYBE6U37WHQ,True,3,Style: SRS-XP500

Being honest I purchased a speaker from a local flea market that sounds louder and it was 1/3 the price. I am a bit disappointed because we LOVE music in our home, we have speakers almost in every room so we are not having to lug them around. I purchased this one mainly to take to the beach and to utilize outside when having get togethers. I will add though that when it is plugged in, and it may just be in my head, but it seems to be louder than when it's just running on the battery which defeats the purpose of a portable speaker with extreme sound. Also the cover does not seal at 100% and although it didn't get inside the compartment where you plug in the extension cord, it did seem as it was wet in the inner part of the seal. And this was just with normal splash of water from when we got out of the pool at home and out of the water at the beach.

I bought 2 of these speakers because I often host outdoor dance events and was excited that it could run on batteries and be linked to another speaker. But I was very disappointed when I got the speaker and started to use it. Here are the issues I had:1. The sound is very quiet when the speaker isn't plugged in! A tiny little bluetooth speaker could contend with this huge speaker for volume when it's running on batteries.2. The bass is just TOO MUCH. If you're only going to use this speaker to play loud house music or something, then maybe that's ok. But playing normal music on this speaker (even with the bass turned down) is uncomfortable and the bass drowns out other instruments in the song.3. Party mode (connecting 2 speakers) just doesn't work! It's constantly skipping like a busted CD. There's NO WAY I could ever use 2 of these speakers for a public dance.4.

R2NBM8ZNKIFTI5,B0BRXJ9WTD,3.0 out of 5 stars Decent sound quality- LACKS BASS,Scott M,3,"The wonderboom 4 is overall is decent speaker especially for rugged terrain and portability. It outshines many competitors for how durable it is with its long battery life and 360 sound. For the price, it definitely lacks ‚Äúdeep bass‚Äù as advertised. I‚Äôll go over the 3 important things; sound quality, battery life, durability.1. Sound quality (for its size)- 6/10-the sound on its small shell is impressive. instruments and vocals sound good alone 3/4 volume. lacks in bass across the board. to advertise this as ‚Äúdeep bass‚Äù is completely false. The bass sounds like loud iphone quality bass. Once at full volume the vocals and instruments collide and the bass is gone too lol.2. Battery life- 10/10-the battery will last you a long time without recharging. I would not be worried about taking this thing all day on one charge.3. Durability- 10/10-the material is rough and feels amazing in hand. I would definitely say this is the most durable speaker I have owned just from feeling the material making it up.Overall- It‚Äôs a nice portable speaker but if it is worth it for you depends on what you use it for. If you are inside and want a shelf or shower speaker, i would not recommend this speaker. If you will bring this thing everywhere with you and want a sleek look and good vocals/music without the need of deep bass, I would highly recommend if it‚Äôs on sale! $100 is pushing it and if you add $30, a JBL flip 6 would be better sound and bass with the same durability and long battery life. Or go with the wonderboom 3 if you don‚Äôt mind the old charging cable, because they both sound identical.OVERALL RATING 7/10","Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2024",AEHG3CRS4T6ALZI4LO24QQ2DS3FQ,True,8,Color: Blue

This speaker is incredibly loud, but the sound is on the shrill side‚Äîtoo much treble and too little bass.I'd still keep the two Wonderboom 4s I bought, but Ultimate Ears makes these speakers turn off automatically even while plugged in after 15 minutes of inactivity. This means that, if you're relying on these speakers for phone, tablet or computer notifications, you're out of luck. What a bone-headed move, Ultimate Ears. How many returns have you gotten over this?Additionally, these speakers do not remember stereo pairing, and I have found stereo pairing to be a nightmare. It takes on average four attempts to get this to work because Bluetooth connection to the device gets lost along the way.I've used lower-priced Bluetooth speakers from Sony, Creative and Tribit that didn't turn off like you do or forget stereo pairing, Wonderboom.What is up with your design team, Ultimate Ears?

R3A7EVL15JEETG,B0BRXJ9WTD,"4.0 out of 5 stars Big sound in a small package, but quite pricey",bobwatts,4,"I have always ascribed to the philosophy that if I‚Äôm going to listen to something, I require it to reproduce the One True Sound. In other words, as close to the original sound as possible. And I listen to music literally all day, sometimes all night also. I don't consider myself an ""audiophile"", a term that is overused, but I am extremely discerning and won't tolerate a poor speaker for more than a couple of seconds.Bluetooth speakers by definition are a compromise and will never be a substitute for a Real Sound System, but some manufacturers perform a lot better than others. And it is an undeniable fact that Bluetooth and wireless speakers are getting far better.In the last four years alone, I have handled, listened to, tested and experienced hundreds of Bluetooth speakers and have written quite a few reviews. (so have millions of other people, hang on I'll get to the point) I bought a lot of them. Paid money. Some over $500.I will rarely mention competitors' products but might ""hint"" at something.Other reviewers have made excellent observations and comments, and I will simply add my own, while trying to cover things that haven't been mentioned.For some reason, I have never purchased UE products, but I'm aware of them and they usually get great reviews. In retrospect, I probably have ignored them based on the price.This is a ""real good"" speaker, but I have to say that for the price, I have certainly heard better speakers for less or comparable prices.The biggest problem is a lack of bass response that other speakers can provide for the same or less money. I realize that with 1.5748"" (40mm) drivers it's impossible to provide low frequency sound, but I will simply choose another speaker to get it. Having typed that, the bass that this speaker does provide is impressive for its size. At least comparable to similar ""name brand"" speakers in this class.The clarity of high frequency sounds and vocals is outstanding, and the mids are very good.As far as the ""360¬∞ sound"" claim is concerned, you can definitely hear a difference when one of the two side drivers is pointed at you.The default EQ sounds best (to me) by a HUGE margin. I can't imagine anyone liking the ""outdoor"" mode, it just removes any of the small amount of bass that is present. Although it makes the speaker noticeably louder, the sound is intolerable. I'll probably never press that button again. Putting it on the bottom out of sight out of mind was a good idea.The USB-C charging port is really buried in the housing, not sure why they did that.I realize the lanyard loop is stretchy, but I can barely get a finger in the thing without pulling it out a bit. Be nice if it was just a bit larger.I'm glad to see that money was spent on sound quality and no silly lights which I usually turn off.Controls are easy to use and function well.Pairing and other sounds are reasonable, and not the obnoxiously loud noises that other speakers make for some ridiculous reason.I did not test battery life or water resistance. I never get my speakers wet, and I have ways around battery life.I can't comment on longevity at this point of course, but that price may reflect quality that will last for many years, or at least I would like to think so.Personally, I would pass on this speaker (and that probably explains why I have for years) because I have heard and own speakers that sound FAR BETTER for the same or less in price. If you NEED a very small speaker, then this is an item to consider.","Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2024",AHF7CXAQGU7WM5KXGQNMTYUOGWLQ,False,6,Color: Black

I like the little stretchy lanyard - so much nicer than long bits of rope or removable ones (my cat likes to chew strings so this little rubberized stretchy loop is a plus). Whether it's worth a hundred bucks is the big question. I think there are better speakers out there for less.

R3TVMZ328RTSE9,B0BRXJ9WTD,"5.0 out of 5 stars A Great little Speaker, Awesome Sound, Durable, Easy to Sse and Waterproof!",Joey Joe,5,"This is a great little bluetooth speaker! Ultimate Ears is pretty well known for quality bluetooth speakers that are easy to use. I've used several Ultimate Ears speakers before, and I'm most familiar with their ""blast"" speaker (which I've been using for years). The Wonderboom is the 4 rendition of their Wonderboom line up. Although the Wonderboom is not currently supported by the Ultimate Ears App (at the time of writing this review). I can say it is so easy to use that I don't really need the App to get this speaker to do what I want. It is easy to pair with bluetooth on your smart device, and although it doesn't have Alex built-in, you can use voice commands through your smart phone or device to help navigate through songs and volume needs. There are 3 buttons on the top, the little dot is to initiate bluetooth pairing, the big one in the center is for syncing this with another speaker, and the button with the line is for On or Off. The plus and minus buttons on the front are for manual volume control, and the tree shaped button on the bottom is for changing modes (Regular, Outdoor, and Podcast are the 3 preset equalizer modes). I was not able to determine if other modes could be added or adjusted. I can say, the regular mode sounds pretty awesome for music especially considering how small this speaker is; less than 4 in wide and less than 4.5 in tall. Even outdoors I find the regular mode sounds great, the outdoor mode just seems to me to boost mid and treble notes to allow the sound to travel further. I like the 360 degree sound. I like that this speaker is waterproof and floats, but I haven't tested those feature. What I like most about it being waterproof is I don't have to worry about accidentally leaving it in the rain, but it makes this speaker valid for boating and water sports, and perfect for use around pools and outdoor water activities. I like that this charges with a USB C cable, which they do include (you provide the USB power source). The charging port is easy to open and close. The short loop/strap on top has a little stretch to it, and is great for carrying this around, hanging on a nail or hook, or to tether it to just about anything else for that matter. I think may favorite part, aside from how easy this is to use, is the battery life. From my experience, it definitely gets the 14 hours of play specified. I used this for an entire weekend with just the original charge! They also claim this is drop-proof from 5 feet, and they offer a 2 year warranty!

The fact that it is waterproof is a great addition.In the hierarchy of my favorite bluetooth speakers, it's up toward the top. To give you some context, here's where it sits in my current speaker list:1) B&O Beosound 2 3rd Gen (Astonishing sound.

Every time I turn it on, I love the sound. Every one of those above cost more that the UEWB4.However - there is one issue that makes it miss 5 stars - (I debated dropping it to 3 vs 4 stars). It drops out for a fraction of a second when streaming music. This happens about every 5 minutes or so, and is quite jarring.This happens on my Android (S24U) and my wife's Android (S23U), and is the ONLY bluetooth speaker that does this.My testing compared it on several tracks, switching back and forth between the this speaker and another. The most comparable speaker I found was the Tribit StormBox2, and it beats it in most categories.If you get one that doesn't drop out (or you don't use Android) recommended.

Sang,4,"I currently use a UE Boom 2 to listen to podcasts while showering and was intrigued by this Wonderboom 4 since it has the advertised Podcast Mode. The use of USB-C to charge is also a big plus.The default mode is bass heavy which is great for music. It's pretty surprising coming out of this tiny speaker. However, I like to turn it up in the shower when listening to podcasts so I can hear it clearly. That's where I thought the Podcast Mode would come in great. Unfortunately it removes pretty much all the bass. Voices are clear and it can get loud, but it just sounds really tinny, like a laptop speaker. I actually found the Outdoor Mode to be my preferred way to listen to podcasts. It reduces the bass without removing it completely.The use of an actual physical button on top is also a welcome change coming from the Boom 2 that required taps that never worked on 100% of the time.One thing I do miss compared to the Boom 2 is an app. I wish the Wonderboom 4 could be integrated into the app so I could do things like silence the startup sound, have it stay on the last used sound mode on startup, and turn it off from the app when I'm not near the speaker.","Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2024",AHDHGGC23BVK3UYXZYD2IFNSG7XQ,False,1,Color: Black
RUJ9O7OGILWSR,B0BRXJ9WTD,5.0 out of 5 stars Punches well above it's weight,E.Swope,5,"Despite having a ridiculous number of speakers in this house I had to try Ultimate ears. Both the wonderboom and Boom have made so many top 10 lists I had to find out what I was missing. That said, I was skeptical, in part because my favorite Sony speakers never wound up on the list (and yes, they are better than several which did). So, I was skeptical of the lists and did not know Ultimate Ears. It was my loss because it is, they both are, great little speakers. I may well put together a top 10 of my own one day, and if and when I do, Ultimate Ears will surely be on it. At this point I want to say that some speakers work better for some people and some for others. It is a matter of your personal taste in music, balance, tonality. All that said I can not think of many people who would not be impressed with this speaker. I wish I had audio specs and feel somewhat at a loss writing a review without them. I would be surprised if it did not have full range sound. Not only is the volume, clarity, balance exceptional, it has a surprising level of detail, comparable to Sony (which does have full range) and maybe even B & O or Klipsch (which have different tonal qualities). I was surprised that it transmitted things like breath on a microphone, and there were moments of bell-like clarity which I have heard almost exclusively with Sony's XM1000 headphones.It also has surround sound, rich bass, no noise or artifacts at any level, and while I imagine it would be most beloved by rock listeners it plays well with jazz. I take speakers through a full range when I test them, and there is nothing which made me go running for another speaker, which quite a few have.It is easy to use, easy to carry and it sounds great. The build and finish is in many ways comparable to Sony's XB series but in my personal opinion it is most nearly comparable to JBL, though I think Ul6timate Ears, but the Boom4 and Wonderboom are more detailed and have a broader frequency range. I do not have a way to test that, so consider it opinion.It doers skip forward and back, and if I have a withhold at all it is that I really do not like the double and triple tapping, long hold, etc. I much prefer dedicated buttons, which this speaker does have for tws stereo pairing. The sound and level of detail is so good that I won't add my usual gripe about lack of high res blue tooth protocols. It really is a very surprising little speaker, and I can see why it made so many top ten lists. If you are still on the fence, try to find a way to listen to this before you buy. It's a very good little speaker.","Reviewed in the United States July 6, 2024",AGASAFHLQKQP7RNG76TKN4GPBJBQ,False,13,Color: Black
R1LBSQQ98L9VTT,B0BRXJ9WTD,4.0 out of 5 stars Expensive for it's sound.,J. Victor,4,"Ultimate Ears is sort of like JBL to me (I have many JBL speakers btw, I'm not a hater, 2 Partybox 100's, 1 Partybox 1000, JBL Xtreme 1, 2, and 4, many JBL Flips etc.) Some of their stuff is just overpriced for what you are getting. I would say the Partybox 100's were definitely worth their price, and the Parbybox 1000, but the Xtreme's and Flips are just too much money for the sound you get. This Wonderboom 4 is like that.It's not a bad sounding speaker. It's warm, plays voices and acoustics nicely, it's just missing meaningful bass. The Earfun U Boom is half the price and sounds bigger with deeper bass. It's also boosted a bit in the mid range, which just gets worse when you use ""Outdoor"" and ""Podcast"" modes. They are unusable to me.Outdoor mode BOOSTS THE MIDS to a ridiculous degree. That's not what is needed for outdoor, you have to boost bass to give it presence and not get lost outside with all of the other sounds.Podcast mode CUTS the already meager bass out entirely, and boosts the mids. It sounds like a toy. You want voices to sound natural and warm, why they did this I have no idea. You should listen to podcasts in normal mode, where they sound good.....I would recommend saving your money and getting a Earfun UBoom, it sounds better, it's warmer with deeper bass and half the price. Same volume at max. OR, you can buy 2x UBooms and pair them in stereo. The UBooms have the same great 360 degree sound of the Wonderboom 4. The wonderboom 4 sounds like a toy against the 2 UBooms.","Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2024",AFY73LAG6WW5YGYHTQ2IQ75BFLRA,False,6,Color: Black

Also, for how small it is, the speaker has great sound range and a decent battery life. I also have the Ultimate Ears MEGABOOM speaker which is twice the size and they have the same quality but this version is half the size. I don't think this wonderboom is compatible for pairing with the megaboom or if it is then I couldn't get it to work. A big bonus for me is the little loop on the top of the speaker so that is can be hung up. Camping, tailgate, at a BBQ etc there are plenty of times where it's easier to have it hung up than trying to find a place to set it down. My favorite thing about this brand is the HUGE + and - buttons on the side of the speaker that function as the volume controls. There is no need to fiddle with tiny buttons, it's so easy to change the volume and anyone around can easily figure that out. I did not test out the waterproof capabilities but it is nice to know it is designed to be durable for all sorts of activities.","Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2024",AGXPYVNF5UJTRYMSU66VJDZGYTFQ,False,0,Color: Black

I'd thought of getting a previous Wonderboom model, but despite all the acclaims from Wirecutter and elsewhere, I just didn't like the idea of using a mini-USB charging cord in this day and age. The Wonderboom 4 speaker upgraded to USB-C, so getting this was a no-brainer.This speaker lives up to the hype. Despite its compact size, it has a really big sound that's clear, has plenty of bass, and great clarity in the mids and highs. It works well both indoors and out, but I'm mostly inclined to use it indoors or while camping/hiking, given its small size and its virtual indestructibility. (I especially like that it floats.) I'm given to using larger speakers outside, like the Lodge (a really amazing product), but for combined portability and sound quality, the Wonderboom rules.The Wonderboom pairs quickly and well, and is very intuitive in its use. I've seen complaints from Samsung users about bluetooth dropouts, but as an iPhone person, this just has never happened in my experience with the Wonderboom. Overall, the speaker works well and sounds great, is portable, and can take a licking in the great outdoors. Just don't play it too loud and upset people in the next campsite, I guess.

I don't have many speakers as small as this one (it's about the size of a softball), but I can confidently say it's the best small speaker I own. Most of my Bluetooth speakers are about the size of a tall soda can, and this Wonderboom beats them all hands down.The size doesn't compromise the sound quality at all. The Wonderboom delivers better treble, mids, and bass than some of my bigger Amazon vendor speakers. You can really tell it's high quality the moment you open the box and feel the materials and weight. Even the turn-on and turn-off chime sounds premium compared to my other speakers.While it doesn't exceed the sound quality of my Bose SoundLink (which costs more, of course), the Wonderboom 4 is perfect for tossing in my tennis bag.

Pairing it was really easy - in fact, there is a transparent, removable sticker that prompts you on how to turn it on and pair it. The manual is similarly user-friendly - easy to read diagrams and text. This thoughtful design continues to the speaker itself, with it‚Äôs large plus and minus for adjusting volume, and it‚Äôs rubberized bottom to prevent sliding.

I‚Äôve been meaning to do a proper review of this speaker for a while now, but finding the time to do so has been difficult. As I mentioned before in a previous post, JBL‚Äôs Bluetooth speakers are excellent. As someone who prefers a HiFi setup (individual components like a receiver, CD player, turntable, bookshelf speakers, etc.), I have never been a fan of Bluetooth speakers. I prefer the definition, clarify, and instrument separation you find in a good pair of passive bookshelf speakers powered by a clean amplifier or receiver, and that preference has not changed. But being able to easily take your music with you wherever you go does have its benefits. I‚Äôve been through quite a few Bluetooth speakers over the years, mainly Ultimate Ears speakers, and I couldn‚Äôt believe how poor the quality of sound was from those speakers. I pretty much gave up on Bluetooth speakers until I decided to try out the JBL Flip 6. For such a small speaker, I could not believe how powerful and clean the sound was. I‚Äôve since tried out the JBL Charge 5, the JBL Xtreme 3, and even the JBL Boombox 3, and each one of those speakers produces great sound. The JBL Boombox 3 is monstrous, and no one really needs that kind of sound unless you‚Äôre entertaining guests in a small or medium-sized venue. At the end of the day, I will always prefer to unwind with a CD or vinyl record played through my stereo receiver and bookshelf speakers at home, and a Bluetooth speaker will never match the clarity and definition of a great pair of passive bookshelf or tower speakers fed by a high-quality amplifier or receiver, but JBL‚Äôs Bluetooth speakers are a good investment if you want to be able to take your music with you. Again, I recommend the Flip 6, but if you‚Äôre able to spend a little more money I recommend the Charge 5 or Xtreme 3.I photographed my Flip 6 perched on two books for scale and also for the promotion of literacy. You know I can‚Äôt help myself. By the way, both of those books in the photo are superb.","Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2024",AGZQIVFUCTPC4TGGHIGE3RURP6AA,True,14,Color: BlackStyle: Flip 6

RVQGQ3BMVNPPU,B09GJMPRYW,5.0 out of 5 stars Small yet powerful little speakers that sound great!!!,The pc builder,5,So let start off by I‚Äôm old school when it comes to selecting speaker. I have a massive surround system that sound great! I stumbled across the little speaker by accident. So I was doing a cell phone upgrade and they asked if I wanted a Bluetooth speaker versus 2 wireless stands‚Ä¶ I opted for the Bluetooth speaker as I had 2 wireless stands that work great. So I hooked this little flip 6 up and was amazed by the sound of this little thing. So I was doing a bit of research and finding that I could hook other speakers. So I opted to pick up another flip 6 and put them into stereo mode. I was floored by the sound out of these little speakers and the stereo field was amazing too!!! So then I was wanting to see how the charge 5 would stack up and then combine them. The one charge 5 has an edge on the bass but the mids and highs of the flip 6 held there ground and sounded a bit better to me. Now I starting thinking of 2.1 sound and this is where everything just shined very bright. Have the best of both worlds highs mids and lows in 3 small speakers!!! Some of the music that I demonstrate in this set up was Rush - The Weapon.. this has some really nice percussion section with some stereo left to right separation. I also played Led Zeppelin‚Äôs- Stairway To Heaven for the same reasons or the stereo left to right separation and over rounded sound. Great news it passes with flying colors and I give these 5 stars all day long. I‚Äôd like to pick up the extreme 3 and give it a go in this set up as it has the AUX jack that would make it useful enough to hook up external AM/FM with USB and SD card. In closing don‚Äôt overlook these speaker I really enjoy my little speaker and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll love too!!!! Update with about a week of playing some music and experimenting. The flip 6 turn on its end with tweeters up will produce the best sound and great sound stage. It does better in the vertical position cause the woofer and tweeter vertically aligned give better sound stage hence the vertical axis. Now pair it with a second and you‚Äôll have killer stereo mode.

It does have great Bose sound, as you would expect. Tho I was after a much bigger sound this time. I really wanted the JBL Boombox, as I have heard them play! But I didn't want to indulge and spend the $400 plus dollars. I‚Äôve had Bose sound before and this was down to a reasonable price for a change. It‚Äôs a great lil speaker. But if you want bigger sound you‚Äôre gonna have to spend the money and go for a bigger version of Bose. This is plenty loud for a great number of people who are just wanting the premium sound :) All in all was a good buy and worth the money for its size and output. Easy to no set up, outta the box charge and play! Also, there is a number of inexpensive covers, cases, frames that make it a ‚Äúboombox‚Äù with handles for easy take along. It came with its own charge cord and a quality clip for the heavy duty loop that‚Äôs built in, so you can clip/hang the speaker wherever you like.

Sound quality is fantastic at all volume levels, its durable and holds up pretty well to the elements. The battery does genuinely last a full 8-10 hour shift playing constantly. A few things to note however.There are no EQ controls for it. Sound is well balanced but theres no bass boost, treble, no nada built in.The app is unnecessary once you get it set up with your device, really only need it to check the battery. The speaker will tell you what its battery percentage is if you turn it off and on though.Max volume is entirely dependent on the device its paired to. If i pair it to my PC, max volume is pretty quiet. If i pair it to my buddy's phone it gets pretty loud, but nowhere near as loud as it is paired to my phone.Volume controls are independent from the device and speaker. You can turn your speaker volume to max but your device is the primary control. So if you have the speaker on low volume and your phone all the way to the max, it wont be as loud as both at max, and vice versa. Its very odd.It does not remember the bluetooth volume of the device its paired to, so if you turn it off and use it the next day, it has a habit of being at full blown volume by default. Just be mindful.Other than that, its excellent and no one will be disappointed by it.","Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2024",AHEGWVGORT2NYKVPVFMFBFDUYI7Q,True,2,Color: Black

No guessing. The sound quality is really decent for the size of the speaker. It can get very, very loud, if that‚Äôs your thing. It has a bass booster that I usually leave on. I appreciate that it is water resistant as I take this into the bathroom, the kitchen, camping, etc. It paired readily with my iPhone.

I don‚Äôt consider myself an audiophile, but I do listen to music religiously ‚Äî 100k+ hours annually ‚Äî and I can appreciate a crisp sounding speaker with nuance. This speaker lacks the nuance. It‚Äôs not terribly loud in my opinion, even on full volume in my small apartment. However, it is durable, and I love that it‚Äôs waterproof. Upon further research, I discovered that Bose is actually NOT worth the value for the money ‚Äî many audiophiles recommend purchasing from another brand, as these speakers can be made for less than $50 and sold for $400+. Initially I purchased the Bose Soundlink MAX and another Flex (product listed here) as well, in hopes of amplifying the sound as well as achieving stereo sound in my apartment.After doing some research, I returned the Soundlink Max and one of the Flex speakers as well. I purchased some ELAC speakers instead for HOME use, and kept one of the Bose Flex speakers for shower use and traveling, as I spend a lot of time on the beach and this is dust and drop resistant. I purchased this on Prime Day for $99 before tax. I would NOT say it‚Äôs worth $150 full price. The battery is not great. I can leave it charging overnight and it dies with moderate use before the day is over. Mediocre in performance overall.It‚Äôs worth nothing that when I purchased the Soundlink Max from Amazon, the box itself clearly states that the speaker comes from Bose ‚ÄúRETURNS AND REPLACEMENTS.‚Äù I believe the speakers sold on sale are probably speakers that were defected or returned by other customers.

R38H6S9H6NZ0KC,B085R7TSN6,"5.0 out of 5 stars Don't believe every review you read, especially negative ones.",CP,5,"Don't believe every review that you read...and only take isolated reported connectivity issues with a grain of salt, especially when they are incorrect. i.e. bluetooth 5.1 connectivity distance etc. Most connectivity issues in my 35 yrs of tech experience are due to ""user error"". Beyond that most can be, and are corrected with a firmware update. Now that being said, my opinion of course here on this unit follows. I have only had this 2nd generation Beosound A1 for a day, so keep that in mind. But right out of the box, this is the best sounding truly portable speakers that I have ever heard, period. Amazingly so, in fact that I have ordered a two more to fit an application that required exactly what these A1's offer. Beautiful clean sound that is loud enough in a large hockey puck style footprint the can be placed under a kitchen cabinets trim, virtually out of sight. How awesome it that? I had zero connectivity issues, and as a matter of fact I was surprised how well the connectivity worked with my iPhone, iPad, and 12"" MacBook. Just as you would expect from a Bluetooth 5.1 device! I cannot and will not comment on Alexa connectivity because if I wanted Alexa capability I would just fire up one of the useless Alexa units that I have in my closet. I can only suspect B&O added Alexa capability because they have some licensing deal with Amazon. As for battery usage I have only had it for a day. But if it comes close to the 18 hours as listed this is even more a winner. And of course this is really portable so you can just plug it as you do your phone to fully charge in 2.75 hours. As for the microphones to be used as a conferencing type device....pretty cool. Though I have not tested them. It will be a bonus if they work as well as the rest of this device's features. You have to keep in mind that if you want Alexa, Siri, Google, and tele-conferencing capabilities you ALWAYS have to purchase dedicated devices for those needs.. If you can get a device like the B&O A1 (2ND GEN) that is ""primarily"" a portable battery operated speaker that you can bring to the beach to be just decent at those other things then you are way ahead of the game.","Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2021",AE23O75IIZVYP34WJST2EBUB4KXA,True,17,Color: Sport

R1GFKXWY2U1CG7,B085R7TSN6,2.0 out of 5 stars Just get a different speaker for around this price bracket.,Louis Valencia,2,"I've been using this speaker since February and I've given it a very long chance, but I keep finding things to dislike about it.I tend to use this speaker at work after we close at my big retail store since there's enough space between me and my other coworkers for me to just enjoy my music and for them to have their own speakers blasting and enjoying their music. THEIR speakers sound better and are louder than this one whether it's a JBL, Tribit, Sony, or Bose speaker. I'll pass by and their music drowns mine. So before I get to specifics, tl;dr, everything I'm about to say is just going to call back to this: just get something else for this price bracket because this speaker will disappoint you.Battery life? This thing will last you roughly 3 hours at max volume. How do I know that? My store closes 5 hours into my shift and I'm using it for the last 3 hours of my shift and by the time I clock out it either already died or is about to die. It also takes an eternity to charge to full. You basically need to leave it overnight for it to charge so if I ever forget to charge the thing 3 hours before my shift, it's not going to charge to full. I had a JBL Clip 4 I got for 60 bucks that lasted longer than this and charged better. Other nitpick about charging this thing is the fact that it turns on automatically when you connect a charger to it and you have to wait a little more than 5 seconds to be able to turn it off. It's annoying.Sound? It sounds fine when it's right next to you. The quality and bass is real nice. But if you step more than 10 feet away from it or if you're at a specific angle away from this speaker, the quality just dips drastically. Like I said, the main thing I really care about it is how loud it is and every other speaker in the $100 bracket around me just outclasses this thing. This thing is in the $200 bracket. I'll step a few feet away from my speaker and barely hear it, but I'll definitely hear my coworkers' speaker from the next aisle over.How does it look? I've seen a lot of reviews saying, ""Oh wow this thing has some kick to it for how small it is!"" This thing is not small. They're lying. Those reviews will make you think it's as no bigger than a teacup plate. No, this thing is surprisingly big and bulky. It will not fit in most hoodie pockets. You cannot clip it to anything because it is also heavy. This thing literally looks like and is the size of a smoke detector.Bluetooth connectivity? Yeah it's pretty good. Very annoying though when I plug it in to charge and it automatically turns on and thus connects to my phone and starts playing sound through it. Like seriously, why is this a feature?Anyways, yeah. Get something else. This thing is not worth it.","Reviewed in the United States August 2, 2023",AEFMXV3RMQLU2W7DDFI42K7MRBCA,True,13,Color: Grey Mist

This may be a rough estimate, but kid you not, I don't have to recharge this unit every day or even every few days.The sound quality is superb. I have it setting on a piano top and get plenty of bass. I can hear the mid and high tones well for instruments, and vocals sound realistic, as if at a small venue concert. Now, I am wondering what the dual unit stereo arrangement would sound like!The mobile app is unique, I've never seen a circular dial display to adjust the treble/bass variably and with as fine variations for an audio device.

Seems this high end brand is pushing a product aimed at a utilitarian application and failing.The trouble started immediately on charging and powering the speakers on. Setup is temperamental. Okay, no sweat. But once set up the units constantly dropped Bluetooth signal causing a popping sound, disrupting the media, and toggling in and out of stereo mode. Stereo pairing was barely functional.Thinking this might be battery related, I purchased a 3x1 USB charger to try the units in an external powered state, which was markedly better. But the signal loss persisted, if less frequently.I decided to perform further testing: the laptop.The B&O performs as poorly with the laptop (2022 HP i7) as the Android with Bluetooth connectivity dropping approx. once per minute at less that 3ft of distance. My wife's $20 bluetooth speaker connected flawlessly under the same conditions, same day and weather. She's not an audiophile, but her speaker works.This would be functionally useless in a social setting and an absolute disaster in a professional setting, like a PowerPoint, where technical problems can kill a presentation. No can do!I am a professional and I demand reliability.As for sound it's pretty clean, but I fail to hear 2x $250 worth of WOW! I opted for Jazz but I also tinkered with Metal and Hip Hop. For Jazz it performed well enough. I would not recommend these speakers to fans of Rock, Rap or Country. Perhaps Classical? The bass is anemic, which is unsurprising for a 4"" driver. I wasn't expecting night club bass. Maybe they want me to shell out another $700 for a sub. Would it sync? Forget it.These speakers do not connect successfully enough to be useful for audio reproduction of any kind, let alone deserving of ""audiophile"" status. Imagine a fancy sports car that won't run. What will your hot date think of your broken down Ferrari, waiting for a tow truck on the side of the expressway? Not much. It simply doesn't work.Give me a Ford F-150 that runs, which is why I might consider something like Bose. I would say that's a fair comparison. B&O have their place but it is not your family barbecue. Maybe Bose or JBL isn't the top of the audiophile line, but if it syncs and plays it is 1000x better than this mess.Avoid.","Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2023",AEROHBBCRM7TESY3O5YRCC5WLP3A,True,2,Color: Anthracite

The B&O gives me great pleasure to listen to. I would put the Bose Soundlink Mini II is my second favorite, and the Sonos third.

For outdoor use I‚Äôve owned the Bose Soundlink (2, actually). It has decent sound for a small unit, although the batteries have tended to die prematurely.I looked for a new option and ran across this B&O unit. I knew the company had a good reputation for quality audio, but had never owned any of their gear. When I initially purchased the A1, I thought, this is okay, but not better than my Bose that cost half as much. Then I began tinkering with the streaming music from my iPad. Two things: 1) On an iPad/iPhone go to Settings>Music>EQ and hit Rock. That brings out the highs and lows of this speaker. 2) Also, I think several weeks of use ‚Äúloosened up‚Äù the speakers and allowed for an improved audio experience. I‚Äôm no audiophile, but it simply sounded better after some use.One tip: put the speaker about 1‚Äô from a wall for maximum bass.The bottom line is, the speaker sounds fantastic, even at lower volumes. It is well built and feels substantial in your hand. I absolutely love it. In all fairness to Bose, I‚Äôve not heard the Revolve II.

RNH3RU6JCMI9F,B085R7TSN6,5.0 out of 5 stars Honest opinion,theRecipe,5,"Original review: After spending 6+ hours with this speaker one thing that I have noticed is that its a personal speaker. You can set it next to you at a lower volume, pump up the bass to a level you want through the companion app and get a full sound, all the while the person on the other end of the couch can barely hear it. Or you can turn it up for others to hear. I added a personal EQ setting that upped the bass so at lower volumes I could have a more full sound. From there as I increase the volume, I move to the ‚ÄúAmbient‚Äù setting and I guess if I cranked it loud enough I would move on to the ‚ÄúOptimal‚Äù setting. I think it just depends on how much bass you want.I ordered a second one to test the stereo sound on this. I‚Äôve read some people had issues with this, so it might not work out. I‚Äôll update this with my findings.Update 1: I found pairing 2 beoplay A1‚Äôs into stereo mode is easy. I had no issues with it. It does not sound any louder in stereo but it sounds good. You can also choose to set them up in mono mode and they sound much louder this way.Update 2: In the end I returned both speakers, I thought they sounded excellent but for $500.00 I could get more sound for less. I ended up with the UE Hyperboom. It‚Äôs stereo or mono, it sounds extremely good turned down low and excellent turned up from medium to high.","Reviewed in the United States March 24, 2021",AELTNTCH226APEWUWWQE34OFKKEA,True,6,Color: Anthracite

I have two complaints, though: the Bluetooth interface is terrible. If, for example, you have the BT connection set to ""calls and audio"", Everytime you get an sms, the sound feed goes into pause mode. The speaker auto-connects to it's last paired device so, for example, if you have both a cell phone and a tablet that you use with the B&O device, you literally need to turn BT off on one (the previous) device to avoid the B&O device from doggedly trying to reconnect with the former device that it was paired with while you're in setup mode. Also, the Gen 2 A1 frequently loses it's Bluetooth connection which puts whatever you're using to stream into pause mode. Then you have to click on the app to continue when the A1 reconnects.I'm also not overly-enamored with the sound quality. It is good, but not great. And this BT-only speaker has a ""it has to sound great"" price tag. My biggest issue, though, is that B&O got rid of the feature that allowed the previous generation to connect via either wifi or BT. I really miss the ability to just connect it with wifi -- and I'm pretty sure the sound quality would be a lot better.These are not huge issues, but when we're talking about equipment from a high-end company like B&O, I expect complete transparency and perfect functionality.

Both are comparable in sound stage presentation. The Bose is slightly louder, but the B&O has options to adjust the sound stage via a semi EQ on their app. I also feel the B&O to be more portable, which is why I ultimately went with it. After some long-term use, I'll update my review, but for now I am thrilled with the B&O Beosound A1.","Reviewed in the United States September 5, 2023",AH24T4DH4F2TNSASW6UBRLZXSE6Q,True,9,Color: Grey Mist

The bass response of the B&O A1 Second generation blew me away. In fact, the bass was too loud in some music.Only disappointment was that there is no tone control (only volume control) on the speaker itself. For this, you need to use the BeoPlay App which I found difficult to navigate.The Instruction Manual provided with the B&O A1 was a completely uninformative waste of paper.","Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2023",AHC6VSELJU4AQGN2NPKBNTPVINKA,True,5,Color: Anthracite

Yes, turning up the volume will require more power. But, if you just like adding ambiance, keeping it below half volume gives great endurance.Bluetooth delay greatly depends on the app being used. For most video streaming purposes, the lag was minimal to where it wasn't a distraction. Games were a few seconds behind which makes this not a good experience.Using the speaker for phone calls worked well.Since I use it daily, it has quite a few dings.

It may have also been sub par to begin with in terms of battery life, but I find myself blown away with how quickly it dies nowadays.The app is horrible, and the Bluetooth connectivity is always a chore. Sometimes I will take me 15 min of switching the speaker on and off, Bluetooth on and off on the device, forgetting the device, re pairing, etc until I get it to work... Which always seems to be random. And it's not just my phone - my wife and kids phones have the same issue, whether using the B&O app or not. Ive never had a Bluetooth device act so poorly in my life.

R3NI3I1VAB4EB0,B085R7TSN6,3.0 out of 5 stars Unusable for video-conferencing,racter,3,"I chose this bluetooth speaker because of its microphone and conferencing capabilities. The microphone quality is awful - grainy, far-away, and distant, and I've gotten complaints from every person I've tried to call on this thing. Furthermore, it has a ""speakerphone mode"" which degrades both input and output quality of the device, and you can't switch it off if you're using the microphone, ie. you can't use this speaker to play high-quality audio while you use a different microphone.The audio quality is good but pairing it with the MacBook Pro which has no system-level equaliser out the box and no B&O app, it's annoyingly bassy when I don't want it to be. It shuts off automatically after a period of time which means I have to re-pair it with my MacBook every now and again if I'm not listening to something continuously, and the Bluetooth pairing isn't alway successful.Overall, nice music-playing speaker. Useless for everything else.","Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2021",AETXTUIU4XGMWSZYLD5LZT4Q6BBA,True,0,Color: Pink

Matysik,3,"I ignored the reviews saying that it‚Äôs not loud enough since I‚Äôm almost 50 and thought I didn‚Äôt need a boom box. I was wrong. The sound is fine but at its loudest, is probably just enough to hear from another room and be okay. But my main problem is that it vibrated off my bathroom sink twice and fell to the floor. My Bose speaker never had done this so it was surprising though you‚Äôd think I would have learned after the first time. I thought perhaps I had placed it precariously and then it fell after the vibrations moved it. But no, even though the bottom FEELS like it‚Äôll keep it stationary, it doesn‚Äôt, so I have to hang it from its rope on my doorknob.I want to love it more than I do. I‚Äôd return it but since it fell twice there are now slight dents along the speaker perimeter so I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs returnable.On the plus side, it looks nice.","Reviewed in the United States March 9, 2021",AFZRKVHSO4QSUTVYB5LZCC4IH6TQ,True,2,Color: Anthracite

When we first received the B&O speaker my family sat around in awe at how something roughly 5"" in diameter could fill a room with such amazing sound. It is expensive, no doubt, but as one reviewer said before me this is simply the best sounding speaker in it's class. We went with the Grey Mist color that not only accentuates the design but makes the controls on the side very easy to see and operate, which I know was a criticism from others who ordered the darker color.

R1RFJO1FULF3WU,B08VL5S148,"3.0 out of 5 stars Good, not great",Christopher Hansen,3,"Update after a month of useI like this unit more than I did initially.While it‚Äôs not as powerful as some of its competitors, it does shine in several categories.This unit really excels in smaller spaces. It really does well when it‚Äôs placed in a corner. It‚Äôs 360 degree sound profile uses the walls to bounce and project sound, using the corner walls as a pseudo speaker cabinet. Sound is much richer used this way.Portability is also a key ingredient. Size and form factor plat a big part. The ‚Äòkiller feature‚Äô is the handle. I know that sounds dumb, but it is really, really useful.The lithium ion battery is also a monster. Took this to the beach, boating and back to a bbq, and only used 25% of the battery life after a full day of activity.The Bose Connect app is what everyone else should aspire to. No gimmicky features. Start it up, connect to your paired device and then stream whatever audio you want from any app.The unit supports multiple people connecting to it simultaneously via Bose Connect so no more ‚Äòwait while I un-pair‚Äô so a friend can play the next song.I‚Äôve also found this is a great audio pairing option for laptop and desktop audio. Much better sound quality than stock speakers, wireless Bluetooth freedom. Our old 27‚Äô‚Äô iMac is in the guest bedroom and we paired this to create a simple audio video system that works quite well for when guests visit.I also use the device occasionally when we golf.When I tested it out at the beach, sound quality was average to good and loudness was enough that we found ourselves constantly turning it down so as to not offend people nearby.Previous review points (below) still apply. Probably would boost it a star if it were cheaper. $300+tax is a big bite for a device of this size. I will keep the unit. I did decide to keep the unit, but mostly just because I can afford to do so.Purchased this unit based upon a ton of positive reviews. Bose clearly took a page out of the Apple design playbook. Very well designed. The handle is a simple, yet awesome feature. The unit is a lot smaller than the pictures depicts.Top quality packaging, and simple setup make using this a breeze. Requires the Bose Connect app from the App Store. The device is primarily intended to be paired to a mobile device or tablet. Skip the Bose opt in (as if we need yet another account and more emails, kthx)Here‚Äôs the rub:While this is an interesting Bluetooth device, it‚Äôs a VERY expensive device. By comparison I paid about $50 more for a HEOS 5 that blows this out of the water in terms of sound quality. While the HEOS isn‚Äôt portable, the bar is pretty high.Overall sound quality is ok, not amazing. Lots of mid range and treble. Bass is present but it‚Äôs not very pronounced. ‚ÄòAcceptable‚Äô but not great.Overall volume output is good, but it‚Äôs not sensational. You‚Äôre not going to throw any keggers or raves. I suspect a small to medium sized group of people wouldn‚Äôt enjoy this very much if they were super talkative of having a lot of fun. I think for lounging on the deck it would be fine. I question whether this unit would be very good for outdoor use. It just doesn‚Äôt have the oomf power to produce enough volume, and I suspect sound quality would be a lot less also.It‚Äôs definitely not a home stereo replacement.Overall 3 stars. Good, not great. If it was $150 it would get another star.For the money involved, you should be able to get some kick $&@ equipment. This unit is decent, but severely overpriced. You‚Äôre paying for the Bose name and a big lithium battery. My daughter‚Äôs Bose Soundlink color puts out almost as much wattage and better Bass at 1/3 the cost.I don‚Äôt think that I can justify keeping this unit for what it cost.ProsGreat form factorHandle!Easy setupSuper long batteryGood soundApp connectConsPriceSound quality could be a lot betterVolume limited - easy to cap outNo sound shaping controls","Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2021",AHYUW5WTHPVO4V44CXRAT7REJMUQ,True,207,Color: Silver

They are very lightweight, portable, easy to use, and can pair multiple speakers via Bluetooth for full surround sound! Seriously! Download the Bose Revolve + II Soundlink App to control them. It does the thinking for you by guiding you through the pairing and steps controlling the units. Easy peezy. I purchased the cases and flat cradle chargers too. Highly recommend all! üëçI personally like a touch more bass in my music, but these things only weigh about as much as my cell phone for Pete's Sake, so this was completely expected as the rule of thumb is: more bass = more weight, and I wasn't about to order portable speakers that had a little more bass and were going to tire me from just carrying them around everywhere.

I had no interest in a single speaker, I already had an altec lansing for that(though the sound is inferior to these). Unfortuntely, the first thing I tried to do was use the Bose Connect App I down loaded before i even got the speakers. Followed the ""intuitive"" instructions and had no problem pairing with each speaker seperately, but to pair two speakers, either for party mode or stereo(you have to be in party mode to intiate stereo) you HAVE to use the Bose Connect App to go into party mode/stereo. It's been 2 weeks and used at least different devices, and I have only managed to get into party mode twice, SO THATS A HUGE FAIL considering the price I paid to be able to pair two speakers!!!!! It's also a HUGE FAIL on the lack of fast charging in 2023/24!!! The sound on these are good for the size, but if they are lacking the most, it's bass, so a seperate subwoofer option would be a nice addition, IF YOU COULD BUILD EQUIPMENT THAT COULD ACTUALLY PAIR WITH OTHER UNITS WITHOUT FAULTY SOFTWARE TO CONTROL IT FIRST!!!!!! Disappointed in Bose. I have owned a lot of Bose products over the years and through out most of them, Bose stood head and shoulders over most competitors with well built, well crafted, industry standard products, but it's always disappointing when a well trusted brand sells you an inferior product, whether it's material, workmanship, design, or software or all of the above. It sucks when you have 2 of the exact same speakers, but you can only listen to one at a time and the only option you have is to struggle to get the manufacturers app to actually do what it's supposed to be created for. DON'T BUY THIS SPEAKER OR ANY OF THE OTHER SPEAKERS IN THIS SERIES THAT RELY ON THE BOSE CONNECT APP IF YOU WANT TO PAIR SPEAKERS!!!!! IT'S NOT WORTH IT.

R13A8CEV5KJI8M,B09XXW54QG,5.0 out of 5 stars So Cool...,John Farrell,5,"I visited a friend on Florida recently and he's building a new house. We went over there to enjoy a few cocktails, it won't be done until May 2024, and brought along his Bang & Olufsen bluetooth speaker and took turns playing songs with our phones while we enjoyed our adult beverages on the water. I don't seem to have the same opportunities to use a bluetooth speaker, but I was very impressed with the B&O speaker. It rocked. I came back to NJ and wanted to get one for myself. These things aren't cheap (the good ones anyway) so I decided I was going to get one during the Black Friday sales. The B&O software, that enables you to pair with their speaker, was a pain in the neck. They were hounding me and sending me e-mails and all the rest. I wanted another alternative. I watched several YouTube videos and was introduced to this Marshall bluetooth speaker. They had me at designing this relatively tiny speaker to look like a real Marshall speaker. Once I read enough reviews I took the plunge. I think I got it on sale for around $120 when all was said and done. It showed up two day later. I pulled it out of the package, charged it up and paired it with my phone. Hate me (or them), but the first song I played with Help On The Way/Slipnot! from Blues For Allah (Grateful Dead). Wow. Absolutely loved the sound and the look. Down the road I will look into either ""stacking"" another one (they have that ability) or just getting a bigger speaker for another potential setting, but right now this thing rocks. If you go camping or just wanted to eat lunch at an outdoor picnic table with some music, this is for you. I'm impressed. I was a bit surprised that it seems as though your phone volume max is also the speaker volume max, but that might be a function of me not understanding how bluetooth actually works. I was kind of thinking I could leave the phone on mid volume and let the bluetooth speaker provide the amplification juice. That doesn't appear to be the case, but it's plenty loud enough in a vacuum. It's a starter speaker so I don't expect it to compete with something an outdoor waterfall or heavy traffic or even a tailgate party where everyone is blasting their tunes, but I'm very satisfied short term. Buy with confidence.","Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2024",AFHFRU22UQRFPEVWBHQFXHBHVYWA,True,3,Color: Black & BrassStyle: Emberton II

This speaker is all you need to sync your music with a clear, superior sound boost. I remember the Marshall amps for my punk rock days. This is a replica of the Marshall amps and that's one of the reasons I chose this speaker. Sound quality has not been sacrificed and it is easy to use. It's all you need. I purchased this a week ago and bought another for my son this week. I will most likely purchase one for my hubby because he is using mine all the time, and yes we have different tastes in music. Look at others if you wish, or save time and get this little powerhouse, Marshall.","Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2024",AEAF6N7CEGGH6D4W7EZV3CTY2EIA,True,1,Color: BlackStyle: Emberton

R1EA1XXVYAUBNB,B09XXW54QG,"5.0 out of 5 stars A simple, solid speaker",L,5,"If you want great sound in a simple package, this bluetooth speaker will do the trick. Initially I found the control button kind of fiddly, but now that I have the hang of it I can manage it easily.Mostly I use this at home when watching movies or listening to the news with some music thrown in. A serious audiophile would probably want a speaker that allows for more control, but the sound profile suits my needs.I've had very little trouble with the speaker losing its connection. There are only a couple of spots in my apartment (~600 sq ft) where the connection breaks up; fortunately, the connection is solid everywhere else, particularly in those rooms where I mostly want to use it.Build quality feels good and solid, like it's going to hold up for a long time. The speaker did get a light spray of water on it one day when I'd left it on my balcony and it suddenly began to rain, but the speaker was just fine.Of course Marshall has a reputation for quality sound gear, but the price still feels a little high given how simple this is. However, if you can get it on sale (as I did) and bring the price down under $100, I think it's worth it.","Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2024",AE23D3SJBYXFUO7OXEAFXXTU2IPA,True,3,Color: BlackStyle: Emberton

There is no ability to toggle any sort of EQ. So the sound you hear, is the sound you get. The thing that I like least about this speaker is the function button. There is only one that you depress in N,S,E, and W for different abilities, but it is loose. It wobbles around like a loose tooth. I would prefer a nice tight button that snaps in each direction.

I mean, I've been forking out $250.00 and more for other speakers. But curiosity got the better of me, and boy, am I glad it did!

That being said, I do love having a large portable speaker that I can put in any room of the house and fill it with music or whatever. It's a bit heavy at 5 pounds and should definitely have had a better base for stability because I'm not sure how well it would survive a fall. It also doesn't seem to ever power off despite the settings I chose for that very reason. That being said, the battery life is ridiculously long and I can leave it on all day without any issues. I do love Sony products but I'm also glad I got this on a promotional sale ($100 off) because I likely wouldn't have paid the normal price.

R1WXFJO25KJ87Y,B0B44FK4XG,2.0 out of 5 stars Worse sound than expected,Strikeout321,2,"We have a large family that likes to listen to music. In my house, we own every JBL Bluetooth speaker (Clip, Flip, Charge, Extreme, Boombox, etc‚Ä¶and the different versions of them), we also have multiple UE speakers (Wonderboom, Boom, and MegaBoom), multiple Sonos speakers (Arc, Mini Sub, One SL, etc.), and one Bose speaker (it‚Äôs older, I forget what). Needless to say, I have a lot personal experience with these devices.In my opinion, this Sony SRS-XG300 is about as good as the JBL Charge 3 or 4 (not 5). I was actually surprised at how bad the low end sound is for this speaker considering its size, the bass is just not there no matter how you try and tune it. Using the Mega Bass button is almost laughable because all it does is add bass, without it, there‚Äôs virtually zero bass. The speaker is not room filling at all and can even sound kind of ‚Äútinny‚Äù during certain sounds with higher pitches. It might be great in a lab with specific sound measuring equipment, but in a real world setting, it doesn‚Äôt sound any better than a medium mid-level speaker that‚Äôs half its size.I paid $148 when it was on sale and would say that‚Äôs about the most I would ever pay for it‚Ä¶but honestly I would just avoid it altogether because even if you got it cheap, you‚Äôll be disappointed once you use it. Go with a JBL Extreme or UE MegaBoom (if you want that larger size speaker), you will be much happier with your purchase. The JBL Boombox is my favorite Bluetooth speaker by far, but it‚Äôs stupid expensive and way overkill for most people.","Reviewed in the United States August 29, 2024",AGNGXFTNXGOGLV6JO4MVPOM5CUUQ,True,0,Color: BlackStyle: SRSXG300/B

R2LKEYDZ9Q0Z57,B0B44FK4XG,5.0 out of 5 stars Great Buy for outdoor needs,KnightFox,5,I switched to this speaker after using the waterproof JBL speaker. Here are the reasons why this was the right decision even though this speaker cost a little more.1. Battery life. I use this speaker 4 times a week for at least 5 hours and I only charge it once a month.2. Waterproof. I take this speaker on a small sailboat during regatta racing. It got not just wet but submerged in salt water few times when a wave washes through the cockpit. It still runs without issues. Afterwards a give it a rinse with fresh water garden hose.3. Sound levels. It has a great sound and packs a punch. The bass is strong. The treble could be clearer.4. It does have an auxiliary input even though it doesn‚Äôt specifically say that in the descriptions on amazon. Bluetooth works great too and is easy to connect.5. It is larger than the jbl speaker and heavier too but that is to be expected if my other points matter to you too.6. Dont buy the case that gets suggested with the product. The grip is too flimsy for the weight of the speaker. Better you get that carry strap that can snap on.,"Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2023",AEGU5Q7IAD6FC2LGLCE4D2GZBBTQ,True,9,Color: Light GrayStyle: SRSXG300/H

When the opportunity presented itself to buy this unit for under $200, it was an absolute no-brainer. It plays loud. Crystal clear loud with a deep punchy bass to boot! And the battery? Well, we had this speaker at a at rendezvous of a motley lot of characters deep within the twigs of the Nicolet National Forest in northern Wisconsin where it was playing at minimum 12-hours straight with plenty to go and only plugged in on a recharge simply because we were not using it. I haven't tested out the guitar plug-in, as of yet. So I cannot report on that aspect. But the lights are cool especially during nightfall if you're into that sort of thing. Oh, and this unit is certifibly solid. It can literally be dragged through a swamp during monsoon season and it won't miss a beat or soak up a molecule of moisture with its superior water tight design. is great when your spending the weekend in camp or at the beach when a sudden downpour shows up on an otherwise sunny day!

The general use is that it's our garage speaker, the kids use it when playing hoops and sauce toss. I also occasionally take it to the patio. Overall I think it has a much better sound than what it replaced with much heavier bass, in fact it could be a little too much for my taste with some music. The sound profiles help to adjust as needed. My expectations on these were pretty low given they are small battery powered speakers but I am impressed with what it produces. I did find the battery life seems to be just ok. We are charging it more than the old speaker but it could also be that the kids are playing it louder.

It came with the cords and instruction manual BUT the speaker itself had no factory stickers or protective film. I found it odd because everyone knows upon purchasing new products - there is usually SOMETHING (such as a sticker and/or protective film) giving the purchaser some type of assurance that they just bought a BRAND NEW product. But I just tried brushing it off and plugged that baby in. I charged it and played a couple songs but that was it. It was late and so it wasn't until New Year's Eve that I had actually tried out the volume level and ""MEGA BASS"" feature and I noticed the second time I actually powered it on that there was definite distortion or static. My friend who was over noticed it as well. So after playing detective and after watching multiple un-boxing videos of the SONY SRS-XG500 I noticed they all came fresh up outta the box with two blue stickers located on the front of the speaker. MINE HAD NOTHING.I called SONY and they confirmed that it most definitely should have had the new stickers attached. They had me to two different reset features in hopes to fix the sound trouble - but to no avail.They (SONY) is sending me a pre-paid shipping label and sending me a NEW SONY SRS-XG500 from the actual warehouse. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY BELIEVE I WAS SOLD A ""RETURNED/REFURBISHED"" speaker.

I was in the Bose camp for many years, but had too many problems with reliability that became a noticeable trend.","Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2024",AEPXBQAO5PXX4JRW2J5IASHMIZBQ,True,5,Color: Black

RSI1GM6014XWY,B07HKQ6YGX,"5.0 out of 5 stars Long Battery Life, Decent Bass",Thomachaan,5,"I replaced my Marshall Bluetooth speaker with this. I chose the Charge 4 over the Charge 5 because it included an analog input (never phase out the 3.5mm jack). Big & heavy, loud & clear, good battery life. I don't use this to charge my phone often but good know I have an emergency backup battery bank.At full volume the battery will drain even with it plugged into a charger. Current draw likely exceeds charging current.Connectivity is faster than any device I own. As long as the Bluetooth is on in my phone, the speaker connect less than 1 second after playing its power-on jingle.Audio quality is not impressive, but it's not bad either. Bass is great for a portable speaker, clear & bouncy, but the high end sounds like there's a blanket over it, lacking clarity. At close distance you can tell high frequency detail is missing, but in general, music played fills the room well.In comparison the Marshall speaker I had played high frequencies super clear, 'CD quality' clear, but the bass was flappy & farty. Given a choice I prefer the Charge 4's bass clarity.I bought a rubber case for it, allowing me to throw it around in the car or move it around in my backpack with more confidence.

R305XBVSZ6PGVZ,B07HKQ6YGX,5.0 out of 5 stars Worth the money.,James Weston,5,So I originally was introduced to JBL speakers when the Charge 2 first came out. Loved it and was immediately a fan and remain to be.Fast forward to 2021. I have been telling any and everyone I come across that when ever in question go with JBL so this last Christmas someone baught me the JBL flip 4 and I was just confused. The sound quality the base???? Even the Bluetooth connection would kick me off about every third song. Returned no problem. I only wanted a replacement anyway. Received the second one and again like the JBL look and feel was there but the sound quality especially the base was just lacking. I was disappointed thinking that the company just dived after the Charge 2. So after getting refund from the second flip 4 spent I think it was an extra 20 25 dollar's?And there it was the sound that made me a fan to begin with. If you're just trying out JBL speakers I would recommend spending just the few extra dollars for the Charge models. I see that the flip 4 and 5 have almost a perfect rating on Amazon so maybe it's just my opinion but I believe the quantity all around of the Charge is a better representative of the JBL brand.The battery in the Charge seems to drain quicker than the Flip but I put my speaker threw it's passes from the moment I turn it on in the morning. Until I am ready to relax in the evening. I literally have nothing negative to say about the Bluetooth connection. No problem's at all. The sound quality is just awesome. I love music period I believe music is the best and purist way to control moods mentally emotionally spiritually and even physically. I listen to anything from gospel to heavy metal blues country rap etc. I have noticed that if the music being listened to is heavy in Base the lyrics will be more clear if you just lower the volume maybe 2 or 3 pushes of the button. If you're listening to sax or blues guitar??!! Albert King for example it only gets better the higher you go. Garth Brooks or Lauren Daigle just over half way of volume and the vocals and piano will be front and center and so on. Even at just little more than half way more than what you would need in the back patio or yard. Man I can't wait till I can get enough for the Extreme or the Boom Box.

R36GGPKZ99X3ZQ,B07HKQ6YGX,"3.0 out of 5 stars Speakers are great for general use. The ap is just o.k (barely. Actually, it sucks.)",Skyrocket,3,"I like the sound from these quite a lot. I bought two of them for stereo. I didn't find the instructions to be helpful, or its ap to be at the same standard as the sound quality - nowhere close actually. You can accept that you will likely like the sound. It's not high end, but it's definitely serviceable for just having on for general, casual use. You'd not consider using these for watching a movie or as a substitute for good headphones or for a demanding listening environment. But for their intended use, their sound is quite good. It took me awhile to figure out that if I wanted stereo, I was going to have to try to figure out how to use the ap. I found that requirement nowhere. That said, the ap isn't intuitive and doesn't remember previous settings. There are performance consequences associated with that inability in terms of what feels like the ap's cumbersome nature. I find the ap annoying.Update: 05/11/2024. Still like the sound; battery life is o.k. to good, but they can take awhile to recharge; the ap, which is needed for stereo, sucks. It's unstable. It does not hang onto your stereo / party mode setting...actually, it frequently defaults to party mode (mono) at the drop of a hat. It's maddening. Setting ap with the speakers is not intuitive, at least it wasn't for me. Whether or not to buy them would really depend on your priorities. If all you care about is sound quality, then sure buy one or two. If what you want is stereo and / or intuitive set up, decide how much those things mean to you, then make your decision.","Reviewed in the United States April 15, 2024",AEAQAPVXTBHL5Z7C54I4EFFXHPYA,True,0,Color: Black
R3UZW22OYTVHWM,B07HKQ6YGX,"5.0 out of 5 stars very good, a little boomy, overall better than Flip5: Updated @ 1 year use",Omar Siddique,5,"UPDATE Aug 2021: After 13 months steady use, I still really like this speaker. It sounds great for a small speaker, and is still my daily driver (heh) for listening to music.BUT... the battery has started getting ""odd"" after the year mark. Occasionally it starts discharging. Not using it (or even leaving it off) doesn't help. It goes all the way to empty (blinking the whole while as if charging) before finally charging back up. That makes for a disconcerting ""speaker might not work today"" effect. When the battery is empty, it won't play at all (turns off), apparently no circuitry to bypass an empty battery.I swapped charger & cable only to have it recur.The pattern, its irregularity, and its recency tell me the likely culprit is the circuitry that regulates charging. Alas there's no mechanism for firmware updates.If it doesn't get any worse, I would still buy another one-- it's been that good. I expect to get at least 2 years use (preferably much more) from a premium bluetooth speaker. I'll report back if the problem worsens...Orig review follows--This is my daily music speaker. It's ""big"" enough to fill a large room by itself, and is well-balanced for music (heavy on the bass). It's substantial (build), stays reliably connected (bluetooth), seems to charge smartly.If you're considering their Flip5 instead (and want just one speaker), get this one instead. The Flip5 only preferred if weight is your primary concern.Pros:* Much bigger sound than expected* Visual battery indicator* USB-C charging* Easy bluetooth pairing. Stays paired consistently with my Google Hub* Can pair with multiple sources, no need to clear the last pairing* Solid sound. Situated in the middle-ish, it easily fills the 40-foot wide open-floorplan downstairs of my home* Easily visible controls & charge indicator* Seems to charge intelligently, so it's no constantly charging, and goes to sleep when not in use.Negatives:* Very boom-y, weak mids, no onboard EQ* No case* On the heavy side if you're traveling with it* I did not evaluate linking up multiple speakersThe one big caveat is how boomy this speaker is-- and it can't be tuned, you'd have to modify the source output instead. So if your primary use is classical music or human speech, consider other speakers.But for music, I love this one after nearly 4 months heavy use! Highly Recommended.","Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2020",AGMITI35DNIHMTUWA6JSEYH43FGQ,True,10,Color: Black

(Not a patch on my vintage L150s, of course. üòÑ )However, they have a really weird gap in the volume. You can have medium loud to as high as they'll go, or pretty soft to very soft, but you cannot have medium. I will turn these down from a little too loud and hear it go to the volume that I want, and then hear it tick down to even softer. I can't believe this couldn't be fixed with a firmware update, and I sure hope it is. I'm a little tired of listening to them just a little louder than I really want.Getting them to stay in stereo mode is a little iffy, and it's really annoying that you have to do it with their app, which really isn't good for much except that. In the first place, you'd think that for two of them stereo mode would be the default, or that it would stay there when you set it, at the very least. And besides that why the heck do I have to use an app?? My little Oontz Angle Pros that cost a third of what these cost, and sound nearly as good, frankly, go into stereo mode and stay in stereo mode all by themselves. I really fail to see why these can't do the same. Again, I bet this could be fixed with a firmware update and I hope it is.Uh-oh. Just found something that might be a deal killer. I was running the pair on batteries to see how long they lasted, and one of them cut off because it's battery had run down. Okay fine. So I plugged in the USB cable and it blinked to show it was charging, but it wouldn't play. Let me repeat that, it wouldn't play. What kind of device won't run off the input power while the battery is charging?? I'm going to see just how long it takes it to condescend to play again, but this issue may cause me to send back yet another pair of speakers. Who designs these things?? This issue is telling me that when the batteries go the speakers are also toast even if they are plugged in. Batteries don't last forever, so I am on the verge of considering that unacceptable, much as I want to keep these.","Reviewed in the United States September 12, 2023",AFAM5OUZ2X5HMUL277QTMYPKADAA,True,10,Color: Black

I've thrown the speaker in pools, lakes, the ocean, and dropped it many times. It is indeed waterproof and for all you people out there wondering, it does somewhat float (to a certain extent), just dont expect the speaker to continuously play if you submerge it underwater. Despite my abuse, it is powerful and has amazing bass and treble, but sometimes the mid high notes gets drowned out when you crank up the bass.The app associated with JBL is hot garbage and keep in mind that only certain speakers within JBL can connect to it if you were considering a multi speaker setup. Some JBL speakers for some reason have an entirely different system.Battery life has been AMAZING to say the least. If I had to guess after like 4 years it still has about 18Hrs worth.I dont use this feature alot but it also has an extra port for charging things which has save me a few times and can charge your phone fully while still able to crank out 2-4 hours of music.Overall one of the best purchases I've every made.","Reviewed in the United States January 2, 2024",AHLMV23AX5U2BUXPNJ75SAXOSN3Q,True,22,Color: Black

I choose my original JBL every time for sound quality. Thought because of the pictures it would pair with mine but apparently I have the one that it doesn‚Äôt pair with. So that stinks too. Nonetheless, I‚Äôll use this one as a back up.","Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2024",AFLZEMJNV2AWXE7PUCISIATIBYNA,True,0,Color: Black

Getting older I realized I could use a little help with heating the TV, I can hear it but I have to turn it up pretty loud, but instead of waiting until the neighbors to start complaining I decided to get a Bluetooth enabled speaker not realizing the my TV, was not a Bluetooth TV, but this speaker did have a headphone jack and it works wonderfully well.","Reviewed in the United States May 6, 2024",AHHULQ3UDFYEXGGXN2KH2XES6ASQ,True,10,Color: Black

R4MREIXG7BMZ,B07HKQ6YGX,3.0 out of 5 stars It's fine... It's connectivity range is pretty nice.,Plant Health Care Coordinator,3,"It's an adequate speaker for this price point. I'll cover the points addressed in other reviews but the short version is the speaker is fine. I do not feel like I wasted money, but if/when I buy another of these types of speakers it won't be a JBL. It's been at least 3 years since I've bought one of these BT speakers and my last speaker was just as loud/clear, cost less, had features that just worked, and even came with a lanyard for easy carry. This thing would be hard to carry for someone with small hands.-Volume and Sound Quality: It's loud in a room with no ambient noise. My music is mostly 90's rock like Metallica, Pantera, White Zombie. I like loud music and for my private office it's perfect.I'll mostly listen at 1/3 volume so I can think, but it's nice to jam out sometimes. At middle volume level the sound is the best (lows vs highs) above half volume the bass tapers off and mostly just the highs are increased volume wise. You could use this in an environment with ambient noise, like a warehouse or kitchen, but you would need to stay around 5' if you want to really enjoy what is playing. After 10' it's probably going to sound more like noise than music.-Phone Connectivity is simple for music just push a top button, but not automatic for phone calls like it was with my other speaker I had in the price point. There are some reviews that cover troubleshooting this, the manual certainly is no help, but it's not what I needed it for. I just liked it as a nice side feature I used sometimes with my last speaker like this.-Battery Life is fine, I haven't done complete testing on this. It does have a pretty significant battery in it for the ""charge your device"" option, but 20 hrs? Maybe at the lowest volume playing nice simple music. I won't need it for longer than 4hrs most of the time, so I doubt this will come up as an issue for me.-There's an app but it does very little for this speaker. Most ""useful"" feature is a digital copy of the horrible instructions that come with the speaker. Thankfully for it's main function of BT Connecting and playing music it's pretty basic and simple. If you go the route of multiple speakers, reads the reviews for the app on how to make that work. It is not intuitive, it's a series of linear steps which the instructions do not help with, and if you do it wrong all kinds of weird issues were reported in the reviews.","Reviewed in the United States September 16, 2022",AHGOEOHFU5YUUOFKOVOFY2O3MXRQ,True,14,Color: Black
